# Timeline Playhead Fixes: Zoom Alignment & Drag-to-Scrub

## üìã Overview

This document describes the fixes for two critical timeline playhead issues:
1. **Zoom-related misalignment** - Playhead position incorrect at non-default zoom levels
2. **Missing drag-to-scrub** - Inability to drag the playhead for scrubbing

## üêõ Problem 1: Zoom Factor Breaks Playhead Alignment

### **Symptoms**
- ‚úÖ At default zoom (1.0x): Playhead aligns correctly with timeline elements
- ‚ùå At zoomed in (2x, 5x): Playhead appears too far to the right
- ‚ùå At zoomed out (0.5x): Playhead appears too far to the left
- ‚ùå Clicking timeline elements seeks to wrong time when zoomed

### **Root Cause**

The playhead was using **percentage positioning** while the timeline container width changed based on zoom:

**Original Code (BROKEN):**
```javascript
updatePlayhead() {
    if (this.playhead && this.duration > 0) {
        const position = (this.playheadPosition / this.duration) * 100;
        this.playhead.style.left = `${position}%`;  // ‚ùå PERCENTAGE
    }
}
```

**Timeline Width Calculation:**
```javascript
const timelineWidth = this.duration * this.zoom * 100;
this.container.style.width = `${timelineWidth}px`;
```

**Why This Breaks:**
- At zoom 1.0x: Timeline is 100px per second ‚Üí 180s = 18,000px wide
- At zoom 2.0x: Timeline is 200px per second ‚Üí 180s = 36,000px wide
- Playhead at 50% of 18,000px = 9,000px (90 seconds) ‚úÖ
- Playhead at 50% of 36,000px = 18,000px (90 seconds) ‚ùå **WRONG!**

The percentage stays the same, but the container width doubles, so the playhead appears at the wrong time position.

### **Solution: Pixel-Based Positioning**

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
updatePlayhead() {
    if (this.playhead && this.duration > 0) {
        // Calculate pixel position based on time and zoom factor
        // timelineWidth = duration * zoom * 100
        // position = (playheadPosition / duration) * timelineWidth
        const pixelPosition = (this.playheadPosition / this.duration) * (this.duration * this.zoom * 100);
        this.playhead.style.left = `${pixelPosition}px`;  // ‚úÖ PIXELS
    }
}
```

**Simplified Formula:**
```javascript
pixelPosition = playheadPosition * zoom * 100
```

**Why This Works:**
- At zoom 1.0x, 90s playhead: 90 * 1.0 * 100 = 9,000px ‚úÖ
- At zoom 2.0x, 90s playhead: 90 * 2.0 * 100 = 18,000px ‚úÖ
- At zoom 0.5x, 90s playhead: 90 * 0.5 * 100 = 4,500px ‚úÖ

The pixel position scales correctly with the zoom factor!

## üêõ Problem 2: Missing Drag-to-Scrub Functionality

### **Symptoms**
- ‚ùå Playhead cannot be grabbed and dragged
- ‚ùå No way to scrub through video by dragging
- ‚úÖ Can only click to jump to positions

### **Root Cause**

The playhead had `pointer-events: none` in CSS, preventing any mouse interaction:

```css
.timeline-playhead {
    pointer-events: none;  /* ‚ùå Blocks all mouse events */
}
```

Additionally, there was no drag handling logic implemented.

### **Solution: Draggable Playhead with Scrubbing**

#### **1. CSS Changes - Enable Interaction**

```css
.timeline-playhead {
    pointer-events: auto;      /* ‚úÖ Allow mouse events */
    cursor: ew-resize;         /* Show horizontal resize cursor */
    transition: width 0.1s ease, background-color 0.1s ease;
}

.timeline-playhead:hover {
    width: 4px;                /* Wider on hover for easier grabbing */
    background-color: #ff4444;
}

.timeline-playhead.dragging {
    width: 4px;                /* Stay wider while dragging */
    background-color: #ff6666;
}
```

#### **2. JavaScript Changes - Drag Logic**

**Added State Tracking:**
```javascript
constructor() {
    // ... existing code ...
    this.isDraggingPlayhead = false;  // Track playhead drag state
}
```

**Added Event Listeners:**
```javascript
// Drag playhead to scrub
if (this.playhead) {
    this.playhead.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
        this.startPlayheadDrag(e);
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation();
    });
}

document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    // ... existing drag/resize handlers ...
    else if (this.isDraggingPlayhead) {
        this.handlePlayheadDrag(e);
    }
});

document.addEventListener('mouseup', (e) => {
    // ... existing handlers ...
    else if (this.isDraggingPlayhead) {
        this.endPlayheadDrag();
    }
});
```

**Added Drag Methods:**

```javascript
/**
 * Start dragging the playhead
 */
startPlayheadDrag(e) {
    this.isDraggingPlayhead = true;
    this.playhead.classList.add('dragging');
    
    // Pause playback while scrubbing
    if (window.editor && window.editor.isPlaying) {
        window.editor.pause();
    }
}

/**
 * Handle playhead dragging (scrubbing)
 */
handlePlayheadDrag(e) {
    if (!this.isDraggingPlayhead) return;

    // Calculate time from mouse position
    const rect = this.container.getBoundingClientRect();
    const mouseX = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const timelineWidth = this.container.offsetWidth;
    const newTime = Math.max(0, Math.min((mouseX / timelineWidth) * this.duration, this.duration));

    // Update playhead position
    this.setPlayheadPosition(newTime);

    // Seek video/audio to new position (real-time scrubbing)
    if (window.editor) {
        window.editor.seekTo(newTime);
    }
}

/**
 * End playhead dragging
 */
endPlayheadDrag() {
    if (!this.isDraggingPlayhead) return;
    
    this.isDraggingPlayhead = false;
    this.playhead.classList.remove('dragging');
}
```

## üé¨ How It Works Now

### **Playhead Positioning (All Zoom Levels)**
1. User changes zoom level (e.g., 2x)
2. Timeline container width updates: `width = duration * zoom * 100`
3. Playhead position recalculates: `left = playheadPosition * zoom * 100`
4. Playhead stays aligned with correct time position ‚úÖ

### **Drag-to-Scrub Workflow**
1. User hovers over playhead ‚Üí playhead widens to 4px, turns brighter red
2. User clicks and holds on playhead ‚Üí `startPlayheadDrag()` called
3. Playback pauses automatically
4. User drags left/right ‚Üí `handlePlayheadDrag()` called continuously
5. Mouse X position converted to time value
6. Playhead updates position in real-time
7. Video/audio seeks to new position (scrubbing effect)
8. User releases mouse ‚Üí `endPlayheadDrag()` called
9. Playhead returns to normal width and color

### **Click-to-Seek (Unchanged)**
- Clicking empty timeline area still works
- Clicking ruler still works
- Both use `seekToPosition()` which already accounts for zoom

## üìä Technical Details

### **Zoom Factor Math**

**Timeline Width Formula:**
```
timelineWidth = duration * zoom * 100
```

**Playhead Position Formula:**
```
pixelPosition = (playheadPosition / duration) * timelineWidth
              = (playheadPosition / duration) * (duration * zoom * 100)
              = playheadPosition * zoom * 100
```

**Mouse Position to Time Conversion:**
```
time = (mouseX / timelineWidth) * duration
     = (mouseX / (duration * zoom * 100)) * duration
     = mouseX / (zoom * 100)
```

### **Event Handling Priority**

The mousemove handler checks in order:
1. `isDragging` - Element dragging (highest priority)
2. `isResizing` - Element resizing
3. `isDraggingPlayhead` - Playhead scrubbing (lowest priority)

This ensures element manipulation takes precedence over playhead dragging.
