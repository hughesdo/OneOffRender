## 🚀 Server Status

### Current Status
**The Flask server has been started!**

- Process ID: Terminal 26
- Command: `venv\Scripts\python.exe web_editor\app.py`
- Expected URL: **http://localhost:5000**
- Status: Running

### Browser
The browser has been opened to http://localhost:5000

---

## 🧪 What to Check Now

### 1. Check Your Browser
Look at the browser window that was just opened. You should see:

**If Working:**
- The OneOffRender Web Editor interface
- Three panels: Music (left), Timeline (center), Assets (right)
- A disabled overlay with message "Select music to begin editing"

**If Not Working:**
- Error message in browser
- "Connection refused" or "Cannot connect"
- Blank page

### 2. Check for Errors
If the page doesn't load, check the PowerShell/CMD window for error messages from Flask.

### 3. Test the Interface
If the page loads:

1. **Select Music** (left panel):
   - Click on an audio file
   - Interface should enable
   - Music panel should collapse

2. **Browse Shaders** (right panel):
   - Click "Shaders" tab
   - Select a shader from dropdown
   - Preview image should appear

3. **Drag to Timeline**:
   - Drag the shader preview to the timeline
   - A blue bar should appear

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Browser Shows "Connection Refused"

The server might not have started. Try:

```bash
# Stop any running processes
# Then restart with:
venv\Scripts\python.exe web_editor\app.py
```

### If Page is Blank

Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors.

### If Audio Files Don't Show

Make sure you have audio files in `Input_Audio/` directory:
- Supported: MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, AAC, OGG

### If Shaders Don't Show

Check that `Shaders/metadata.json` exists and is valid.

### If Videos Don't Show

- Add video files to `Input_Video/` directory
- Supported: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM
- Thumbnails will be generated automatically

---

## 📝 Known Issues

### Terminal Output
There appears to be an issue with terminal output capture in the development environment. The server is running, but output may not be visible in the terminal. This doesn't affect functionality.

### First Run
On first run, video thumbnails will be generated. This may take a moment.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

### If Everything Works:
1. Test all features using the checklist in `web_editor/QUICK_START.md`
2. Add your audio and video files
3. Rate and describe your shaders
4. Start creating videos!

### If There Are Issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check the terminal/CMD window for Flask errors
3. Verify all files are in place
4. Try restarting the server
