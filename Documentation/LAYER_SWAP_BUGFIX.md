# Layer Swap - Drag & Drop Bug Fixes

## 🐛 Bug Reports

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: ✅ All Three Bugs Fixed
**Files**: `web_editor/static/js/editor.js`, `web_editor/static/js/timeline.js`

---

## Bug #1: Error Message Display (FIXED)

After the layer swap implementation, the drag-and-drop validation error messages were displaying incorrect layer numbers.

### Symptoms (Bug #1)
- When trying to drop a shader on Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos), the error message said "Layer 1 (Green Screen Videos)" instead of "Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos)"
- When trying to drop a video on Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions), the error message said "Layer 2 (Shaders & Transitions)" instead of "Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions)"

### Root Cause (Bug #1)
The error messages in the `onTimelineDrop()` method were using the **old layer numbering** from before the layer swap:
- Old system: Layer 0 = Shaders, Layer 1 = Videos
- New system: Layer 0 = Videos, Layer 1 = Shaders

The validation logic itself was correct, but the error messages were not updated during the layer swap.

---

## Bug #2: Inverted Drop Behavior (FIXED)

After fixing Bug #1, a second bug was discovered: elements were dropping into the WRONG layer.

### Symptoms (Bug #2)
- When dragging a shader and dropping it on Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions), it actually dropped on Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos)
- When dragging a video and dropping it on Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos), it actually dropped on Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions)
- The error messages displayed correctly, but the actual drop behavior was inverted
- Elements appeared to "snap" to the wrong layer when released

### Root Cause (Bug #2)
The `findAutoConcatenationPlacement()` method in `timeline.js` had **inverted layer restrictions**:

```javascript
// WRONG (Old layer assignments)
const canUseLayer0 = elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';
const canUseLayer1 = elementType === 'video';
```

This logic was still using the OLD layer assignments from before the layer swap:
- Old system: Layer 0 = Shaders, Layer 1 = Videos
- New system: Layer 0 = Videos, Layer 1 = Shaders

The layer restriction logic was never updated during the layer swap implementation.

---

## Bug #3: Wrong Layer When Dedicated Layer Doesn't Exist (FIXED)

After fixing Bugs #1 and #2, a third bug was discovered: elements were dropping into wrong layers when their dedicated layer didn't exist yet.

### Symptoms (Bug #3)
- When dropping a video after a shader was already placed, the video went to Layer 2 or Layer 3 instead of Layer 0
- When dropping a shader after a video was already placed, the shader went to Layer 2 instead of Layer 1
- The behavior depended on which type of element was dropped first
- Elements were not using their dedicated layers (0 for videos, 1 for shaders) when those layers didn't exist yet

### Root Cause (Bug #3)
The "create new layer" logic in `findAutoConcatenationPlacement()` at line 127 was calculating the new layer number incorrectly:

```javascript
// WRONG - Always creates next sequential layer
let newLayerNum = existingLayers.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingLayers) + 1 : 0;
```

**Example of the problem:**
- If Layer 1 exists (with shaders) and you drop a video
- It calculates: `newLayerNum = Math.max(1) + 1 = 2`
- But videos should use Layer 0, not Layer 2!

The logic didn't check if the dedicated layers (0 or 1) were available before creating a new sequential layer.

## The Fixes

### Fix #1: Error Messages (`web_editor/static/js/editor.js`)

**Lines 497-505** - Updated error messages:

#### BEFORE (Incorrect)
```javascript
// Validate drop for specialized layers
if (!this.isValidDropForLayer(data.type, targetLayer)) {
    if (targetLayer === 0) {
        alert(`Layer 1 (Green Screen Videos) only accepts videos.\nPlease drop shaders and transitions on Layer 2 or below.`);
    } else if (targetLayer === 1) {
        alert(`Layer 2 (Shaders & Transitions) only accepts shaders and transitions.\nPlease drop videos on Layer 1 or Layer 3+.`);
    }
    return;
}
```

#### AFTER (Correct) ✅
```javascript
// Validate drop for specialized layers
if (!this.isValidDropForLayer(data.type, targetLayer)) {
    if (targetLayer === 0) {
        alert(`Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos) only accepts videos.\nPlease drop shaders and transitions on Layer 1.`);
    } else if (targetLayer === 1) {
        alert(`Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions) only accepts shaders and transitions.\nPlease drop videos on Layer 0.`);
    }
    return;
}
```

---

### Fix #2: Layer Restrictions (`web_editor/static/js/timeline.js`)

**Lines 78-80** - Fixed layer restriction definitions:

#### BEFORE (Incorrect)
```javascript
// Check layer restrictions
const canUseLayer0 = elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';
const canUseLayer1 = elementType === 'video';
```

#### AFTER (Correct) ✅
```javascript
// Check layer restrictions (Layer 0 = Videos, Layer 1 = Shaders/Transitions)
const canUseLayer0 = elementType === 'video';
const canUseLayer1 = elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';
```

---

### Fix #3: New Layer Creation Logic (`web_editor/static/js/timeline.js`)

**Lines 125-144** - Fixed new layer number calculation:

#### BEFORE (Incorrect)
```javascript
// All layers are full, create a new layer starting at time 0
// Determine appropriate starting layer based on element type
let newLayerNum = existingLayers.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingLayers) + 1 : 0;

// Ensure new layer respects restrictions
if (newLayerNum === 0 && !canUseLayer0) {
    newLayerNum = canUseLayer1 ? 1 : 2;
} else if (newLayerNum === 1 && !canUseLayer1) {
    newLayerNum = 2;
}

return {
    layer: newLayerNum,
    startTime: 0,
    duration: Math.min(duration, this.duration)
};
```

#### AFTER (Correct) ✅
```javascript
// All existing layers are full or skipped, create a new layer starting at time 0
// First, check if we can use the dedicated layers (0 or 1) if they don't exist yet
let newLayerNum;

if (canUseLayer0 && !existingLayers.includes(0)) {
    // Videos should use Layer 0 if it doesn't exist yet
    newLayerNum = 0;
} else if (canUseLayer1 && !existingLayers.includes(1)) {
    // Shaders/transitions should use Layer 1 if it doesn't exist yet
    newLayerNum = 1;
} else {
    // Both dedicated layers exist or are not applicable, use next available layer
    newLayerNum = existingLayers.length > 0 ? Math.max(...existingLayers) + 1 : 2;
}

return {
    layer: newLayerNum,
    startTime: 0,
    duration: Math.min(duration, this.duration)
};
```

## Summary of Changes

### Bug #1 Changes: Error Messages

#### Error Message for Layer 0
**OLD**: `"Layer 1 (Green Screen Videos) only accepts videos.\nPlease drop shaders and transitions on Layer 2 or below."`

**NEW**: `"Layer 0 (Green Screen Videos) only accepts videos.\nPlease drop shaders and transitions on Layer 1."`

**Changes**:
- ✅ "Layer 1" → "Layer 0" (correct layer number)
- ✅ "Layer 2 or below" → "Layer 1" (correct target layer)

#### Error Message for Layer 1
**OLD**: `"Layer 2 (Shaders & Transitions) only accepts shaders and transitions.\nPlease drop videos on Layer 1 or Layer 3+."`

**NEW**: `"Layer 1 (Shaders & Transitions) only accepts shaders and transitions.\nPlease drop videos on Layer 0."`

**Changes**:
- ✅ "Layer 2" → "Layer 1" (correct layer number)
- ✅ "Layer 1 or Layer 3+" → "Layer 0" (correct target layer)

---

### Bug #2 Changes: Layer Restrictions

#### Layer Restriction Logic
**OLD**:
```javascript
const canUseLayer0 = elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';
const canUseLayer1 = elementType === 'video';
```

**NEW**:
```javascript
const canUseLayer0 = elementType === 'video';
const canUseLayer1 = elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ `canUseLayer0`: Shaders/Transitions → Videos
- ✅ `canUseLayer1`: Videos → Shaders/Transitions
- ✅ Added clarifying comment about layer assignments

---

### Bug #3 Changes: New Layer Creation

#### New Layer Number Calculation
**OLD**: Always create next sequential layer (`Math.max(...existingLayers) + 1`)

**NEW**: Check dedicated layers first, then create sequential layer

**Logic Flow**:
1. ✅ If element can use Layer 0 AND Layer 0 doesn't exist → Use Layer 0
2. ✅ If element can use Layer 1 AND Layer 1 doesn't exist → Use Layer 1
3. ✅ Otherwise → Create next sequential layer (2, 3, 4, ...)

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added check for Layer 0 availability before creating new layer
- ✅ Added check for Layer 1 availability before creating new layer
- ✅ Ensures dedicated layers are used when appropriate
- ✅ Prevents videos from going to Layer 2+ when Layer 0 is available
- ✅ Prevents shaders from going to Layer 2+ when Layer 1 is available

---

## Validation Logic (Bug #1 - Unchanged)

The validation logic in `isValidDropForLayer()` was already correct and did not need changes:

```javascript
isValidDropForLayer(elementType, targetLayer) {
    // Layer 0 is dedicated to green screen videos only (top visual layer)
    if (targetLayer === 0) {
        return elementType === 'video';  // ✅ Correct
    }
    // Layer 1 is dedicated to shaders and transitions only (bottom visual layer)
    if (targetLayer === 1) {
        return elementType === 'shader' || elementType === 'transition';  // ✅ Correct
    }
    // All other layers accept any type
    return true;
}
```

## Why These Bugs Occurred

During the layer swap implementation, we updated:
1. ✅ Layer labels in `timeline.js` (lines 341-359)
2. ✅ Validation logic in `editor.js` (`isValidDropForLayer()` method)
3. ✅ Rendering pipeline in `render_timeline.py`
4. ❌ **Error messages in `editor.js`** - **MISSED THIS** (Bug #1)
5. ❌ **Layer restrictions in `timeline.js`** - **MISSED THIS** (Bug #2)
6. ❌ **New layer creation logic in `timeline.js`** - **MISSED THIS** (Bug #3)

### Why Bug #1 Occurred
The error messages were overlooked because they were in a different part of the same method (`onTimelineDrop()`) and not immediately adjacent to the validation logic.

### Why Bug #2 Occurred
The `findAutoConcatenationPlacement()` method in `timeline.js` was not identified during the layer swap implementation. This method handles the actual placement logic when elements are dropped, and its layer restriction checks were still using the old layer assignments.

### Why Bug #3 Occurred
The new layer creation logic (lines 125-140) was using a simple sequential approach (`Math.max(...existingLayers) + 1`) that didn't account for the dedicated layer system. It assumed layers would always be created in order (0, 1, 2, 3...), but with dedicated layers, we need to check if Layer 0 or Layer 1 are available before creating higher-numbered layers.

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Changes
1. **Search for all references**: When changing layer numbers, search for ALL occurrences of "Layer 0", "Layer 1", "Layer 2", etc.
2. **Check error messages**: Error messages often contain hardcoded values that need updating
3. **Test user-facing messages**: Verify that all user-facing text is correct, not just the logic
4. **Use constants**: Consider using named constants instead of magic numbers for layer IDs

### Potential Improvement
Instead of hardcoded layer numbers in error messages, we could use a layer name lookup:

```javascript
const LAYER_NAMES = {
    0: 'Green Screen Videos',
    1: 'Shaders & Transitions'
};

// Then in error messages:
alert(`Layer ${targetLayer} (${LAYER_NAMES[targetLayer]}) only accepts...`);
```

This would make future changes easier and reduce the chance of similar bugs.

## Critical Lesson Learned

**When swapping layer assignments, search for ALL layer-related logic:**
1. ✅ Layer labels (UI display)
2. ✅ Validation logic (what's allowed)
3. ✅ Error messages (user feedback)
4. ✅ **Placement logic (where elements actually go)** ← This was missed!
5. ✅ Rendering pipeline (how layers are rendered)

The placement logic in `findAutoConcatenationPlacement()` was the hidden culprit that caused Bug #2. It's easy to miss methods that don't have "layer" in their name but still contain layer-specific logic.
