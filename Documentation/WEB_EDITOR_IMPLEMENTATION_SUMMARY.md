## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Rendering**: Integration with render_shader.py needs to be completed
2. **Playback**: Real-time preview not yet implemented
3. **Project Persistence**: Save/load framework ready but not connected
4. **Layer Collision**: Elements can overlap without warnings
5. **Transition Enforcement**: Transitions not restricted to element boundaries

All of these are intentional - the framework is in place and they can be implemented as needed.
