i didnt have ffprobe installed


your audio is totally wrong.
The first visual was Paze (whos that guy?) xor mashup 03.  The ball did nothing.
Shadertoy does a 1024 fft and throws away the last 512 bins with .8 smoothing.  Your sampling bass and trebble and ignoring the rest.

And 20 minutes for 1.5 minutes ;P



Technical Request
"I need to increase our FFT resolution to match Shadertoy's implementation. Currently our FFT resolution is too low for the audio-reactive effects I'm trying to achieve."
More Detailed Version
"Could you help me implement a 1024-point FFT for audio analysis, similar to what Shadertoy uses? Here are the specs I'm looking for:

1024-point FFT (instead of our current lower resolution)
Real-time processing at 60fps if possible
Magnitude spectrum only (no phase data needed)
Frequency range: 0Hz to Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate)
Output format: Normalized values [0.0 - 1.0]
Frequency bins: 512 usable bins (since it's magnitude-only)

The goal is to have enough frequency resolution to create smooth audio-reactive visuals. Right now the FFT resolution is too coarse and the effects look choppy.
Reference: This should work similar to Shadertoy's audio input system where frequency data is accessible as a texture/array with good resolution across the spectrum."
Key Technical Points to Mention

Current FFT size (if you know it)
Target: 1024-point FFT
Need magnitude spectrum only
Real-time performance requirements
Output should be normalized floating-point values




My requirements seem to be missing ffprobe. The RunMe.bat script already installs missing Python libraries, so it should also handle this dependency. I need the script to fully initialize the environment and set up all requirements for first-time users, making the tool easy to use out of the box. Right now, the only missing piece appears to be ffprobe.
